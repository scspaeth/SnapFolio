        <h4>Translation Development</h4>
        <p>Jens posted about the need to develop translations 
            <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/help/ target="_blank">
            Contributing to translation dev.</a>
            <a href="./dev/UnicodeIntnl3WithSupe-su.xml" target="_blank"-->
                UnicodeIntnl3WithSupe-su.xml</a>. 
                This illustrates the potential. 
                Using this venue to improve understanding and skill with version control management.
        </p>
        <h4>Language translation testing</h4>
        <p>Jens recently announced progress on internationalization of Snap! 
        He started with an obvious first choice: Deutsch (German), his native language. 
        In comments in the source code, he warns against full-scale translations 
        because the code for supporting localizations is still in active development. 
        </p>
        <p>The change from English to Deutsch consists primarily of string and 
        special single character substitutions. 
        These only require Western (ISO-8859-1) encoding.
        Test that by switching between Western (ISO) and Unicode (UTF-8) encodings.
        For Jens' lang-de.js, that difference in encodings does not affect display.
        </p>
        <p>But for many languages, the changes are more significant. 
        For East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean CJK), 
        the changes are more substantial and require Unicode.
        To see this, watch the Japanese text in the body of this page become illegible 
        on the change from Unicode (UTF-8) to Western (ISO-8859-1). 
        In this work, I have chosen Japanese for Alpha testing of localizations 
        that require Unicode.</p>

        <h2>Details of the testing approach and results</h2>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Microsoft introduced the concept of Pseudo Translation to 
        support internationalization of its software. 
        The most important feature here is substitution of unicode strings
        that both test the program's support for other character sets, 
        yet are legible in English so that testers don't need to know a second language.</p>
        <h3>日本語 (Japanese language)</h3>
        <p>The Japanese language uses four different character sets:
        <ul>
        <li>Hiragana: phonetic "alphabet" for words of Japanese origin, e. g. です</li>
        <li>Kanji: ideographs drawn primarily from Chinese written language, e. g.　日本 Japan.</li>
        <li>Katakana: phonetic representation of non-Japanese origin, 
        	e. g. スペース "space" as in space-bar on a keyboard.</li>
        <li>Romaji- the Roman alphabet, e. g. ａｂｃ．．．ｘｙｚ．</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Extend Pseudo Translation to include all Japanese character sets</h3>
        <p>Devise representative substitutions from Japanese character sets to 
        test program function but still be legible in English language. 
        One simple approach is to substitute Romaji characters for English
        but that approach does not cover all character sets.
        A judicious choice of character look-a-likes from Kanji, hiragana and katakana and
        fill in with Romaji for letters in in the Roman alphabet for which there
        are no appropriate substitutes.</p>
